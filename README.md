# Athena
The Greek Pantheon mentions Athena as the goddess of war, education and intelligence. There are many Gods who claim the war like titles. And some of them deserve it too. Athena is different, she symbolises the victory of intelligence and strategy over brute force in a world where strength is prized over information.

Athena digests stock market date. She knows where to download it from, where to save it, how to convert it so that other programs on a user PC/server are able to use her intelligence. 
The aim is to be unobtrusive, intelligent, farreaching and in short highly effective.

If you need to download stock market data for a certain program, why bother the user with date, format and conversion settings. All you need to ask her is the path and which program its for. Why not just sit in the background and download this every day at the same path and for the same format.

Features like these are worth having. They donot present themselves readily. That's why I made this program.
