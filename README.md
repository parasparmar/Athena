# Athena
The Greek Pantheon mentions Athena as the goddess of war, education and intelligence. There are many Gods who claim the war like titles. And some of them deserve it too. Athena is different, she symbolises the victory of intelligence and strategy over brute force in a world where strength is prized over information.

Athena digests stock market data. She knows where to download it from, where to save it, how to convert it so that other programs on a user PC/server are able to use her intelligence. 
Features like hers are worth possesing. They will not, ever present themselves readily. That's why I made this program.


Tommorow, soon.The aim is to be unobtrusive, intelligent & farreaching,  in short; highly effective.
If Athena needs to download stock market data for certain existing programs on her PC, why bother the user with date, which programs, their native formats and conversion settings. All She needs is to ask for the save path and how far back to go. She has demi-gods who do her work. She sits in the background and coordinates this every day. 

Some day soon, Athena will scrape web pages for asset data, weigh it and be able to use a 360 approach to investing. She will be opinionated, highly intelligent and live for the fun of seeing traded assets amass wealth for her followers.
