# Athena
The Greek Pantheon mentions Athena as the goddess of war, education and intelligence. There are many Gods who claim the war like titles. And some of them deserve it too. Athena is different, she symbolises the victory of intelligence and strategy over brute force in a world where strength is prized over information.

Athena is a stock market data downloading service. The aim is to be unobtrusive, intelligent and farreaching.
For Eg : If you need to download stock market data for a certain program, why bother the user with date, format and conversion settings. All you need to ask her is the path and which program its for. Why not just sit in the background and download this every day at the same path and for the same format.

Features like these are worth having. They donot present themselves readily. That's why I made this program.
